# About
App was built in android native sdk. This was one of my first applications ever built and was before I discovered flutter sdk, which come to think of it 
would've really helped develop faster and more efficiently. But I don't regret learning android native as it helped me further understand android applications at a
more fundamental level. 

I built this app before I knew much about a backend & REST api, so much of the database interaction is on the client side using firebase CLI. 

# Technologies
Android native sdk (java) & Firebase CLI
